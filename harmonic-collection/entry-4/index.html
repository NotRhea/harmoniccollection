<div class="intro" style="font-size: 25px;"><h3><b>FIRST THINGS FIRST</b></h3>
<p>FOOD.SUSTENANCE. The first order of business is to
    get some food in that belly because I know you obviously
    didn’t have a filling dinner. I started off my day with a 
    big bowl of oats to get me going. Breakfast is KEY so you 
    don’t spend more than you have to at the overpriced cafes 
    you’re about to enter. </p></div>

    <div class="the-first-cafe"><h3><b>THE FIRST CAFE</b></h3>
    <P>The first cafe you go to should be very near to your house. 
        I chose the right across tompkins square park. 
        Time to start that essay! 
        BUT FIRST, you need to buy something. 
        Normally I would go for their specialty- the vietnamese iced coffee, but my stomach today was just not accepting any form of caffiene. So I went with an iced matcha latte instead. If you can stomach it and want the cheapest possible option, an iced americano is your best bet.

        <DIV class="onto-the-next-one"><h3><b>ONTO THE NEXT ONE</b></h3>
       <p> You can typically stay at the first cafe for a few hours , but based on personal experience, after 2 hours they start giving you dirty looks. Time to move on to the next one. Now I for one am starving, so lets go to a place that serves both cafe and food. My favorite one is <b>ESSPRESSO AND KITCHEN </b>, because it has this GORGEOUS outdoor area where I can sit and work. Its an amazing workplace. Take a small breather and work there. I got the to eat. Youve been working for quite a while now right? But I bet youre still just around 600-700 words down and the sight of your laptop makes you want to vomit and just smash it into pieces. Time for yet another location change, and this is my personal favourite. </p></DIV>

       <div class="NYULIBRARY"><H3><B>THE FINAL LEG:NYU LIBRARY</B></H3>
   
        <p>Time for the final showdown. Grab all ammunition(your laptop) and head to the NYU library(bobst) which is nestled right across washington square park.
         I come here when I have absolutely no inspiration to work, because looking at everyone work makes me feel like I am not doing anything with my life and that feuls me to work. </p>
         <P>Im sure by this point your creative juices are churned out, and what really helps me is to give myself little treats and rewards for completing basic tasks. So set a small goal like maybe completing 100 words and you get to buy one treat from the vending machine. Within an hour or maybe two hours at most you should be done with your essay!Using so much brain power is sure to burn away a lot of your will to exist, but don't worry, be proud of yourself for completing your task! Time to treat yourself again, because you deserve it. 
         If you’re feeling bougie and like splurging , then head over to <b>SPRING CAFE ASPEN</b>, which serves amazing vegan food. </P>
         <P>However if you still want to keep your day under budget, head down to <b>MAMOUNS</b> which is pretty close to bobst and grab a sandwich for yourself for just 6 dollars, and maybe even a drink if youre really feeling like treating yourself.</p>
        <p> My title actually says under 50 dollars, but my total for today barely came up to 30 dollars! You can get it to be even lower based on what you buy and where you choose to go. </p></div>
